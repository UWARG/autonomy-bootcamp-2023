If you're interested in seeing how the simulation black box works, the code is here. Feel free to explore and see how it all works.

However, at runtime, please use the provided API in the bootcamp. Do not directly access anything in here, not even for debugging! A goal of the bootcamp is to familiarize yourself with interacting with black boxed systems, as there are several in Autonomy.
